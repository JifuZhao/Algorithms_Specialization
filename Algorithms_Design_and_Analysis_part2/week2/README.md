# Question 1

### clustering.py
* A much faster method using Kruskal MST algorithm

### clustering(bruteForce).py
* Not a good method, naive implementation, running time is too long


# Question 2
### clustering_big.py
* Refer to online discussion about find closest nodes
* A little tricky methods, takes about 92 seconds in Python

### clustering_big(bruteForce).py
* Using Brute Force method to calculate the Hamming distance
* I haven't finished the running, will take too much time.
