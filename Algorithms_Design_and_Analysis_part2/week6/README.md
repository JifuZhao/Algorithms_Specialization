# 2-SAT problem

### Papadimitriou's Algorithm
* Papadimitriou.py implements the Papadimitriou's 2-SAT Algorithm
* However, the running time is too long.
* This script only tested on the test file: 2sat_satisfiable.txt and 2sat_unsatisfiable.txt. Not tested on the assignment files.


### Kosaraju's Two-Pass Algorithm (reduced to SCC problem)
* Kosaruju.py implements the Kosaraju's Two-Pass Algorithm to compute the strongly connected components (SCC)
* The original 2-SAT problem reduces to SCC problem
* Running time gets improved a lot
